- Also Created a navigation to Expense sheet to know total expense category & sub category wise

# Insights & observations:
1. No Debts in Specific Months (Feb, Jul, Sep, Oct, Nov):
  - Why?: Debts may have been repaid earlier or are not due in these months.
  - Improvement: Use debt-free months to save or pay off future debts faster.

3. Income Below Target (May, Jul, Sep, Oct, Dec):
  - Why?: Likely seasonal income fluctuations or drops in side income.
  - Improvement: Build savings in high-income months or diversify income sources.

4. Differences in Main & Side Income (Jan, Apr, Nov):
  Why?: Side income spikes due to special projects or seasonal work.
  Improvement: Aim to smooth out side income with consistent opportunities.

5. Housing is the Highest Expense, Except in Jan & Feb (Transportation Highest):
  Why?: Housing is a fixed cost, and transportation costs spike in early months.
  Improvement: Reduce transport costs by using alternatives; optimize housing costs with energy savings or refinancing. 

# Suggestions:
- Debt Strategy: Use surplus from no-debt months to repay high-interest debt.
- Income Stability: Save or invest surplus from high-earning months.
- Expense Cuts: Minimize discretionary spending like dining or subscriptions.
- Budget: Set a budget based on the lowest projected income for stability.
